Work at Argus Soft was performed as part of a Ukrainian engineering team delivering projects for Ukrainian/European markets. Requirements were gathered and structured by project managers in collaboration with customers and transferred to development via Jira/Confluence.

> The work initially focused on full-stack JavaScript development, covering mobile, frontend, and backend tasks. As projects evolved and complexity increased, responsibilities gradually expanded toward system-level design and architectural work.

> A key long-term project was a premium passenger transportation platform. Mobile applications for iOS/Android were developed with complex UI and animations, geolocation and maps, background processes, and real-time interactions. In parallel, a web-based admin panel was implemented for operational management, including map features, geocoding, live data updates, and release preparation with publishing to the App Store/Google Play.

> In addition, several corporate web platforms and administrative panels were delivered across different business domains. These included multilingual websites built from design layouts, content management interfaces, image and data uploads without code changes, server-side logic, and database integration.

> A later stage involved long-term outstaff work in the banking domain, where the focus shifted toward technical leadership and solutions beyond JavaScript. A system for official communication and document exchange was developed and integrated into an existing remote banking interface, including requests, chats, document exchange, antivirus scanning, qualified electronic signatures, access control, session management, and audit logging.

> In parallel, architectural work was carried out on modernization of a legacy core system. Together with an analyst, the business domain was decomposed and a universal DDD core was implemented using Java-based technologies and delivered as an architectural foundation for future internal development.

Worked on a complete rewrite of the client-side application from scratch. The main goal of the project was to migrate an existing jQuery-based front-end to a modern architecture using React.

> The front-end was developed in parallel with a new backend, so mock data was used to decouple client-side development and maintain steady progress. This approach allowed full implementation of user flows, interaction logic, and UI behavior independently of backend readiness.

> As part of the rewrite, the application architecture was designed, core screens and reusable components were implemented, and a color scheme editor was introduced to enable flexible UI customization. Particular attention was paid to code structure, component reusability, and preparing the front-end for seamless future integration with server-side APIs.
