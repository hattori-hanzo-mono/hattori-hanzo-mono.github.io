# About me

---

Software engineer with continuous commercial development experience since 2005. My primary focus and strongest area is building software products from scratch, including architecture design and implementation of the full technology stack.

I have practical experience covering the full development lifecycle and am capable of independently driving a project from technical concept to production release. At the same time, I work most effectively in a team-based model where communication with the client and requirement management are handled by a project manager or analyst. This approach helps avoid requirement distortion and allows me to fully concentrate on engineering tasks — architecture, implementation, and long-term technical stability of the solution.

> I primarily work within Ukrainian engineering teams, where clear professional communication and a shared working language inside the team are established. In team-based development, I consider a common technical and communication context to be an important factor that positively affects solution quality, development speed, and predictability of results.

> I am comfortable working both independently and as part of organized teams with clearly defined roles and processes. I prefer collaboration models where the company acts as a fully responsible party in the project, providing coordination, process support, and accountability for delivery, rather than shifting managerial or client-facing responsibilities onto developers.

> Due to my long and uninterrupted career, I have a broad understanding of web development, both modern and established technologies, and common architectural patterns. I favor a pragmatic engineering approach without unnecessary complexity, focused on quality, maintainability, and sustainable product growth.
